HIGH PRIORITY:

  [ ] Create vehicles and vehicle components
  [ ] iso8016 datepicker (TIMEZONES DUMMY!!!)
  [ ] Move search form to left column of screen
  [ ] Flash messaging
    [ ] Loading
    [ ] Searching
    [ ] Error

CONSIDER:

  [ ] Bound autocomplete geographically for maximum speed (user's location?)
  [ ] Display a map of the vehicles, thus cementing reservejs's obsolescence
