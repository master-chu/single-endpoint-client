HIGH PRIORITY:

  [√] Stub fake data for after-hours work
  [√] Add colors to server messaging (NEED BY JUNE 1st!!!! MAKE OR BREAK ZIPCAR!!!)
  [√] iso8016 datepicker (TIMEZONES DUMMY!!!)
  [ ] Move search form to left column of screen
  [ ] Create vehicles and vehicle components
  [ ] Smarter defaults
    [ ] Start/End time
    [ ] Location lat/lng
  [ ] Flash messaging
    [ ] Loading
    [ ] Searching
    [ ] Error

CONSIDER:

  [ ] Point at staging for after-hours work
    Getting a 500 and a CORS error... but in the browser i can hit the endpoint (though im unauthorized)
    [ ] Change host
    [ ] Generate auth token
    [ ] Selector for localhost vs staging
  [ ] Bound autocomplete geographically for maximum speed (user's location?)
  [ ] Display a map of the vehicles, thus cementing reservejs's obsolescence
