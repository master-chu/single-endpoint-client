HIGH PRIORITY:

  [√] Stub fake data for after-hours work
  [√] Add colors to server messaging (NEED BY JUNE 1st!!!! MAKE OR BREAK ZIPCAR!!!)
  [√] iso8016 datepicker (TIMEZONES DUMMY!!!)
  [√] Move search form to left column of screen
  [√] Vehicles count
  [√] Create vehicles and vehicle components
  [√] Smarter defaults
    [√] Start/End time
    [√] Location lat/lng
  [√] Flash messaging
    [√] Error
    [ ] Loading
    [√] Searching
  [ ] Display a map of the vehicles, thus cementing reservejs's obsolescence
    [ ] Wrapper component called SearchResults containing the map and table

CONSIDER:

  [ ] Point at staging for after-hours work
    Getting a 500 and a CORS error... but in the browser i can hit the endpoint (though im unauthorized)
    [ ] Change host
    [ ] Generate auth token
    [ ] Selector for localhost vs staging
  [ ] Bound autocomplete geographically for maximum speed (user's location?)
